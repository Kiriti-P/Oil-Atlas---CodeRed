Problem Statement
Create a solution that analyzes and/or displays oil and gas production in the United States in an informative way.



Our project is Oil Atlas, and we produced a webapp that reports oil production in the Us based on criteria. 

Our web application takes information about oil production from different ___, and produces an informative chart on the criteria in which a person is looking for. We also have a section so that the consumer can also see the stock prices of the top 10 oil companies at the time. We used ReactJs for the front end implementation, along side Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript. The backend uses RESTful API with Axios, and a docker file. 

To run the app you must run locally on a machine using the npm start.
